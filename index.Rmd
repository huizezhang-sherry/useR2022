* Thanks everyone for coming 

* The title of my talk today is

* Here is the link to this slide and the link now is also available in the chat. 

* Spatial data are a common type of data and here there are 59 weather stations distributed in New South Wales and Victoria in Australia

* The data are organised in an `sf` class and the package `sf` provides various geometrical operations in the space for this class

# Temporal data

???

* Temporal data are another common data type 

* Here I'm showing you some historical daily temperature data for those 59 stations. 

* On the right, a fraction of the data in year 2020 is plotted

* This data is stored in a `tsibble` class, with `id` as the key to define each series and `date` as the index to define the time stamp. 

* With the `tsibble` class, you can do many temporal wrangling and build temporal models. 

---

# Spatio-temporal data 

When left joining an `sf` object with a `tsibble` object, the `tsibble` class (`tbl_ts`) gets lost: 

```{r sf-tsibble, echo = TRUE}
out <- stations_sf %>% left_join(ts, by = "id")
class(out)
```

When left joining the other way around, you lost the `sf` class:

```{r tsibble-sf, echo = TRUE}
out2 <- ts %>% left_join(stations_sf, by = "id")
class(out2)
```

???

* However, spatial objects and temporal objects do not naturally work well together for spatio-temporal analysis. 

* Here let me give you some examples

* If I join an sf object with a tsibble object, the tsibble class would gets lost

* The `sf` class gets lost, if the data is joined in the other way around,

---

# Multivariate spatio-temporal data

You can manually enforce the joined object to have both classes:

```{r echo = TRUE}
out2 <- ts %>% left_join(stations_sf, by = "id")
out3 <- out2 %>% st_as_sf()
class(out3)
```

but the class lost again after a `tsibble` operation: 

```{r echo = TRUE}
out4 <- out3 %>% tsibble::fill_gaps()
class(out4)
```

???

* We can manually enforce the joined object to have both classes  with the function `st_as_sf()`

* But the class label can still get lost during operations.

* Here I use a tsibble function `fill_gaps` and the output no longer has the `sf` class

* Also, taking a step back, the left join approach on spatial and temporal data is not necessarily the best way to structure spatio-temporal data 
* This is because all the feature geometries are repeated multiple times, especially for long daily data, like the `ts` data I just show you.

* This motivates a new data representation

# Cubble

## A new tidy data structure to organise and wrangle spatio-temporal data

???

* Today I will introduce a new data structure, called cubble, to organise spatio-temporal data. 

* And we will see how data wangling with cubble can be fun 


---

# Multivariate spatio-temporal cubes

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/spatio-temporal-cube.png")
```


???

* Conceptually spatio-temporal data can be thought of as a data cube

* In this cube, the three axes are Time, Site, and Variable.

  * The axis **Site** defines the location of the entities

  * The axis **Variable** is used to represent multivariate information.

  * We define our data cube slightly different from a conventional cube to avoid introducing hypercubes for multivariate information.

* Operations on multivariate spatio-temporal data can be thought of as slicing and dicing on the cube. 

* The data cube is conceptually convenient, but for data wrangling a 3D array structure may not sufficiently rich, for example, to wrangle special date time class.



---

# Cubble basics

```{r out.height=575}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/long-nested-form.png")
```


???

* Now I will demonstrate how cubble organises spatio-temporal data with two forms. 

* The nested form organises each site in a row. 

  * Spatial variables fixed for each site can be directly wrangled. 

  * Temporal variables varied across time are nested in a list column called `ts`. 

* On the other hand, the long form cubble organises each row by a combination of site and date, similar to a `tsibble`.

  * Temporal variables can be directly wrangled and spatial variables are stored as a data attribute, which I will show you shortly in the code.
  
---
# Switching focus between time and space

```{r out.height=575}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cubble-operations.png")
```

???

* In a spatio-temporal analysis, we may want to first subset a few location and then explore their temporal patterns.

* We may also want to first calculate some temporal features and then investigate its spatial distribution.

* These analysis would require switch between the nested form and the long form in a cubble

* The function `face_temporal()` turns a nested cubble into the long form and

* We can first filter the location on the nested form and use `face_temporal()` to switch the data into the long form and thenmake temporal summaries

* The inverse of `face_temporal()` is `face_spatial()`, which switches the long cubble into a nested one

* With `face_spatial()` we can first make some calculations on the tmeporal side and switch back to the nested form to view its spatial distribution on the map

---

# Creating a cubble

```{r echo = TRUE}
weather <- as_cubble(list(spatial = stations_sf, temporal = ts),
  key = id, index = date, coords = c(long, lat))

```

???

* Now I'm going to show you how to create a cubble from the two data earlier. 

* Here you specify the two separate objects in a list with the name `spatial` and `temporal`. 

* Then you can specify the `key` and the `index` as what you would do when creating a `tsibble`. 

* The `coords` argument needs to be speicified in the order of longitude and latitude. 

--

```{r}
weather
```

???

* This creates a cubble in the nested form. 

--

- .sec[`r nrow(stations_sf)`] stations, in the nested form, and is a subclass of `sf` 
- The available temporal variables are `date` and `tmax` 
- Also, each temporal component in the list column is a tsibble (`tbl_ts`)


???

* The header of a cubble tells you this data has 

---
# Cubble summary (1/2)

.pull-left-larger[

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(width = 50)
```

```{r face-temporal, eval = FALSE}
weather_long <- weather %>% face_temporal()
weather_long
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
decorate_chunk("face-temporal") %>%
  flair("face_temporal()", background = "#FFEECF") %>% 
  knit_print.with_flair(width = 50)
```

  - a long form cubble as the subclass of `tsibble` 
  - the third row now shows the spatial variables

]

???

* We can turn this object into the long form with `face_temporal()`

* Now the object `weather_long` is a long form cubble and it is a subclass of tsibble

* The third line in the header now changes to see the available spatial variables

--

.pull-right[

```{r echo = TRUE}
attr(weather_long, "spatial") 
```
  

]

???

* The spatial variables are stored in the `spatial` attribute, which you can see through this command.  

* Here it is stored as an sf object

---
# Cubble summary (2/2)

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(width = wide_width)
```

```{r face-spatial, eval = FALSE}
weather_back <- weather_long %>% face_spatial()
weather_back

identical(weather_back, weather)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
decorate_chunk("face-spatial") %>%
  flair("face_spatial()", background = "#FFEECF") %>% 
  knit_print.with_flair()
```
???

* Here is the code example of using the function `face_spatial()` on the long form cubble

* This would give us the identical nested cubble before switching to the long form

???

* Here is a comparison of the syntax using cubble and tidyverse dplyr for the same analysis

* With cubble, you can do some spatial analysis in the nested form, pivot ot the long form for some temporal analysis, and back to the nested form for some additional steps on spatial. 

* Without cubble, sometimes, you may need to extract some interesting stations after the spatial analysis and you will need to do some filter steps on your temporal data to keep both sheets updated. 

* You will need to do this similar manual spatial update 

* while with cubble, once the data is subsetted in one form, it will automatically update in the other form. Also with cubble, all the operations can be piped into the next step with no intermediate objects floating around the workspace.

# Transform a dot into a glyph

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/glyph-steps1.png"))
```

???

* Some spatio-temporal analysis may involve both types of variables at the same time. 

* An example of this is making glyph maps.

* Here I'm going to show you how to transform a dot on the map into a glyph before giving out the full example

* A glyph map is a transformation of temporal variables into space. 

* Here I have a weather station on the map and its maximum temperature on each day in January 2020

---
# Transform a dot into a glyph

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/glyph-steps2.png")) 
```

???

* A glyph map transforms the coordinates in the time series plot into the spatial coordinates, so that temporal information can be visualised in a map

* In a glyph map, the coordinates of the time series plot are called the minor coordinates and the spatial coordinates are called the major coordinates.

---

# Transformation to glyphmap

             x_minor = date, y_minor = tmax)) + 
  geom_glyph()
```

]

???

* All the four coordinate variables need to be in the same table to plot with ggplot2

* In cubble you can use the verb `unfold()` to relocate spatial variables into the long form. 

* Here I have the diagram illustration, cube transformation, and the code to show this function.

* After this step, the data can be piped into the ggplot with `geom_glyph()`, also from the cubble package, to draw the glyph map.

# Example: Australian temperature

```{r out.height=530, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/temperature-workflow.png"))
```

???

* Now here is an full example that combines everything I have just introduced, to analyse historical temperature data with cubble. 

* All the stations I have shown you have maximum temperature dated back to the 70s, so we can compare the maximum temperature in the past and nowadays, also across space.

* The diagram here shows how different steps in the data analysis can be chained together with cubble 

* Start with a created cubble, we can first filter out the NSW stations in the space, and then pivot to the long form to filter for the two time periods

* Then with the long form, the maximum temperature is summarised into monthly average

* In step 4 we switch back to the nested form to find that some stations don't have history records and drop those

* In step 5, we switch to the long form again and migrate the longitude and latitude to prepare for the glyph map transformation. 

* And lastly the glyphmap transformation gives you a map.

* This is the code version of the previous diagram and the functions highlighted here are I developed in cubble

* In the plot, I show an enlarged legend of one station Cobar

* In each glyph, I plot the averaged maximum temperature for September to February for the two periods

* One information I read from this plot is in the past, the average maximum temperature from December to February are almost the same, while these days, January stands out to be hotter for the inland stations
